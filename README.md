## FTCM-Loader

### Notice: this doesn't work yet!
I accidentally an npm publish whoops.


This library is a webpack loader for Friendly-Typed-CSS-Modules. It's super cool and you'll love it.


### How to Use
If you use this loader, you'll be a happy person. You might also want to add a pre-hook to your webpack yarn command.

```
ftcm -p src/**/*.scss -c
```
